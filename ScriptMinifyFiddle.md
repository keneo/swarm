Minify lua script and copy paste it into minecraft computer console

TODO:
=====
* Decrese cost (characters count) of encoding of space i.e. by using regex replace
* Remove dependencies to third party hosted js libs
* "Copy" buttons
* * make it work: http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/2.0.2/dependencies/luaparse,luamin/keneo/swarm/tree/master/pc-tools/LuaMinifyAnsCopyPasteFiddle/
